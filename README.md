# VTT AI Translator
## About
This is a notebook to translate VTT subtitle / caption files more fluently than traditional translation tools using the OpenAI API and webvtt. It can be switched to Deepseek easily in the future for more cost-efficient processing. Made by Connor Wright for Georgia Tech's Buzz Studios Filmmaking Club. 

## How to Use 
* Clone the repo
* Change the folder / file paths to the respective vtt
* Set a language using the ISO language code
* Put in an OpenAI API key (or ask for mine)
* Run all the cells
